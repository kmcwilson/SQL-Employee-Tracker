# Employee Tracker

## Description

This application allows a business owner to be able to view and manage departments, roles and employees in their company. The application allows them to use the application to plan their business. 
I have used SQL as well as inquirer to prompt the business owner as to which action they would like to perform. 
Their choices are as follows:
View Employees
View Departments
View Roles
Add an employee
Add a role
Add a department
Update an employee role

The database is seeded using my seeds.sql and these will be the initial names and positions that are available.
